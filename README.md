This is the first Task.

I create a graphic editor with following class hierarchy:

1. **Shape** - base class for all shapes with a method to display the name of the shape.
2. **Circle** - derived class from Shape.
3. **Square** - derived class from Shape.
4. **Rectangle** - derived class from Shape.
5. **Triangle** - derived class from Shape.
6. **Polygon** - derived class from Shape.
7. **Quad** - derived class from Shape.
8. **ShapePrinter** - class that takes a Shape object and prints its name.

Attention to the use of OOP features - interfaces, abstract classes, access modifiers.
Trying to design a flexible architecture that can be easily extended in the future.
